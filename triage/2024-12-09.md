# 2024-12-09 Triage Log

A pretty quiet week, with both few PRs landed and no significant changes in performance.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.

#### Regressions

None this week.

#### Improvements

Remove polymorphization [#133883](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/133883) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=75716b45105e443199ce9800c7009ddfd6d2be53&end=ca13e9169fbbbb126190631b5a1e3e20053a52c1&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range          | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (primary)    | -     | -              | 0     |
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (secondary)  | 0.5%  | [0.3%, 0.7%]   | 6     |
| Improvements ✅ <br /> (primary)   | -0.5% | [-1.3%, -0.1%] | 91    |
| Improvements ✅ <br /> (secondary) | -0.7% | [-1.7%, -0.3%] | 21    |
| All ❌✅ (primary)                 | -0.5% | [-1.3%, -0.1%] | 91    |

This is essentially a solid improvement. We still did the evaluation of
polymorphization even if it wasn't actually enabled, so this just saves that
time by dropping all of that computation.

Mixed results, but seems like a real regression on a few larger benchmarks in
opt, non-incremental scenarios. Possibly due to
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/133798, trying an unrolled build to
verify.

Root-caused and discussed here:
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/133607#issuecomment-2524194699, some
optimizations expected to reduce the impact.

Implementation of `fmt::FormattingOptions` [#118159](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/118159) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8dc83770f748c6cd16b342889ca2240397c19534&end=75716b45105e443199ce9800c7009ddfd6d2be53&stat=instructions:u)

A few regressions in primary benchmarks, but not worth follow-up given the
small magnitude, small number of affected builds, lack of clera `cycles`
impact, etc.

Expected regression in doc builds due to additional trait implementations in the standard library.

Single benchmark regression, limited to incremental scenarios. Seems plausible
this is due to #133992, which obviously does more (necessary for correctness)
work.

Expected changes, primarily an improvement rather than a regression. Overall a positive change.
