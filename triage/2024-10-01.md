# 2024-10-01 Triage Log

A quiet week without too many perf. changes, although there was a nice perf. win on documentation
builds thanks to [#130857](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/. Overall the results were positive.

cfg option.
- It caused some small codegen perturbations, but it does not seem to warrant further changes.
- Marked as triaged.
