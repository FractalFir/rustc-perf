# 2024-12-03 Triage Log

Busy week with more PRs impacting performance than is typical. Luckily performance improvements outweighed regressions in real world benchmarks with the largest single performance gain coming from a change to no longer unconditionally do LLVM IR verification in debug builds which was just wasted work.

Triage done by **@rylev**.

- The regressions in the primary benchmarks reverted back to their previous mean after a few PRs so I don't think this is necessarily worth looking further into.

- Post merge perf results are a bit different from the pre-merge run, but they look similar enough that this doesn't require more investigation.

- Perf regressions are small enough that I don't think this requires investigation especially considering that one of the primary regressions returned to its previous state a bit later on.

- "Only a small regression, multiple strategies were tried here and in other PRs to get to this result — and it's a necessary hit."
